# Build a network to do transactions on blockchain Wallet

The Assignment basically concentrates on implementing a public blockchain from scratch and by building a simple application to leverage it. It includes creation of endpoints for different functions of the blockchain, such as adding a transaction, using the Flask micro-framework, and visual studio code is used to provide packages and environment. It also includes how to build a simple user interface that interacts with the blockchain.
The present goal is to make a website that allows users to share information and the uniqueness is the content is stored in blockchain so it is immutable.
 
A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. A distributed data storage consisting of containers (blocks) which are connected. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority.
 
AIM:
 To build a simple web application that allows users to share information on a blockchain
having  properties
·  	History Immutability
·  	Data Persistence
·  	No single point of failure
 A transaction by a user has the following three data points:
·  	Sender
·  	Recipients
·  	Timestamp

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
Python
Flask Microframe
JSON format to store data
Visual Studio Code
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The project consists of code in different phases:
Storing data into blocks
Making blocks immutable
Chaining blocks
Mining new blocks
Share Data, Resolve conflicts
Wallets
Analyze and Verify Chain
